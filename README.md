A quick and fun app to search for goods prices using web scraping without depending on any existing platform. 

Known issues:  
  
  0. Existing searching method is quite unstable, requires an improvement or might be changed completely.
  1. Slow, I have some ideas to make it use multiple threads, but more time is needed.
  2. DB needs more site frames, both for testing and proper usage.
  
Improvement ideas:
  
  0. TESTS!!!!!!!
  1. Customer functionality(profile, cart, etc).
  2. Admin functionality - make it possible to add site frames using app itself, instead of hardcoding or putting it directly into the DB.
  3. Web scrap WebArchive to get price graph dynamincs.
  4. Design changes.
  5. Seperate BE and FE instead of MVC, probably Angular.
